                    My career path reflects a deep curiosity about how different systems work, stemming partly from my background as a Japanese major exploring language and culture. This curiosity often led me to operational roles where I could tackle poorly understood processes. I actively moved from Sales to Operations at Apple specifically to demystify the 'black box' of backend logistics, driven by a desire to learn what was unfamiliar. This same drive motivates my current exploration of AI through Pursuit â€“ diving into a complex, evolving field to gain new skills and understand how technology can solve operational challenges in novel ways, sometimes seeking opportunities where my language skills might add value. It's rooted in my belief that continuous learning is essential.

                    At Apple, I developed strong investigative and analytical skills, using SAP and collaboration to resolve complex inventory issues and understand root causes. I translated this analysis into tangible results, like cutting customer pickup times by 50% and improving inventory accuracy through process changes. My current AI training focuses on practical application, using tools like Langchain for data parsing and leveraging generative AI to rapidly prototype solutions. My comfort with complex systems like SAP allows me to quickly learn and apply these new AI tools effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I offer a unique blend of grounded operational experience and emerging AI skills, enabling me to realistically assess where technology can provide practical value in complex, real-world scenarios. My 'trial-by-fire' background ensures I focus on solutions that work, and I excel at translating technical details into clear insights for diverse audiences, drawing on perspectives gained from cross-cultural study. Fueled by a 'need to know,' I dive deep to understand systems, troubleshoot effectively, and ensure solutions genuinely support operational teams, rather than just implementing tech for its own sake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I'm a versatile problem-solver and collaborator, adapting my approach to best support my team and the challenge at hand. My core vision is to act as a 'translator of complexity,' bridging the gap between technology (especially AI) and practical operational needs across diverse business contexts. I believe AI should serve as a tool to automate routine work, freeing people for more critical tasks, and I aim to help build those efficient, human-centric environments. Achieving this provides the foundation for pursuing my personal passions, including cultural exploration and language practice, outside of work.

                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Many guitarists struggle with understanding music theory concepts like keys and scales in real-time practice.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I developed a web application that provides immediate, visual feedback. It plays chord drones in a selected key/progression and uses microphone input to indicate if the player's notes are in key. It also displays interactive fretboard diagrams.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This tool translates abstract music theory into an intuitive practice aid, making learning more engaging and effective by providing instant, easy-to-understand feedback.</p>
