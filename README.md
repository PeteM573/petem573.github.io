# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills and experience as a "translator of complexity".

## Tech Stack

*   Vanilla HTML5
*   CSS3 (with CSS Variables)
*   Minimal JavaScript (for scrollspy)

## Development

No build step is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the site locally.

*   Modify content directly in `index.html`.
*   Adjust styles in `styles/main.css`.
*   Update scripts in `scripts/main.js`.
*   Place images in `/assets/images/` and other assets (like PDF resume) in `/assets/pdf/`.

## Deployment

This site is designed to be deployed using GitHub Pages. See Stage 5 instructions.

## TODOs

*   Replace all placeholder content marked with `<!-- TODO: ... -->` in `index.html`.
*   Refine styles in `styles/main.css`, particularly spacing, responsiveness, and hover effects.
*   Add your actual project screenshot to `assets/images/`.
*   Add your resume PDF to `assets/pdf/`.
*   Create and add favicons.
*   Add meta description and Open Graph tags for SEO/sharing.
*   Perform accessibility and performance audits (e.g., Lighthouse).
